About Innoplexus

When we looked at the decision making the landscape in organizations and observed that the available technologies and models were supporting decision making but with fixed cycles of information processing, running in batches, with little flexibility and agility. We saw products sacrificing usability for more features, deployment times of months and requiring days or weeks of training to get started.

That is when we founded Innoplexus to disrupt the way of decision-making processes and to drive digital transformation in data analytics. By building intelligent applications we bring together Research, Engineering, UX-Design, and other experts to use machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to solve the toughest problems from curing cancer to predictive analytics. Recently we integrated Blockchain technology to add formerly unpublished (meta)data to our data ocean.

 

We are aiming to be the leading provider of Artificial Intelligence solutions and striving towards it day by day.

Founded in 2015, Innoplexus AG is headquartered in Eschborn, Germany, the main development center in Pune, India, and commercial center in Hoboken, USA.
